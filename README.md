# Expert or Liar - A .NET MAUI Mobile App

## About the App

Expert or Liar is a trivia game app inspired by the “Regular Show” episode “Expert or Liar.” The app, developed using .NET MAUI, allows users to test their knowledge in various categories. Users answer a series of questions and are labeled as an “expert” or a “liar” based on their score. The app integrates with Firebase Realtime Database for storing and retrieving questions and user data.
